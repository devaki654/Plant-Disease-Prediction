# Plant Disease Detection

This project is designed to detect plant diseases using machine learning models and computer vision. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on various plant disease datasets to classify plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.

## Project Overview

This project uses a Flask application that integrates a pre-trained model to predict plant leaf diseases. The model classifies the leaves into categories like healthy and diseased (with various disease labels like "leaf_spot", "rust", "powdery_mildew", etc.). The results, including images, are stored in a MongoDB database, and the Flask backend fetches and displays them on a web page.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Disease Detection:** The model predicts the disease or health of a plant leaf from a live video feed.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Plant images and their corresponding disease details are stored in MongoDB.
- **User Interface:** A simple HTML page to interact with the application and display prediction results.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** For the web application backend.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building the CNN model to detect plant diseases.
- **MongoDB:** For storing plant images and metadata.
- **OpenCV:** For processing live video feeds.
- **HTML/CSS:** For the frontend user interface.
- **GridFS:** For storing large image files in MongoDB.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up MongoDB:**

   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or use a cloud MongoDB instance like MongoDB Atlas.

   ```bash
   # On local setup:
   mongod
   ```

5. **Load the pre-trained model:**

   Download the trained model (e.g., `leafplant.keras`) and place it in the project directory.

6. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## Usage

- **Upload Image:** You can upload an image of a plant leaf to the Flask web interface to detect if the plant is healthy or diseased.
- **Real-time Detection:** The system also allows real-time detection from a live camera feed.
- **Results:** The disease classification, along with the relevant image, is stored in MongoDB and displayed on the webpage.

### Example Request:
You can also interact with the backend via API calls (if implemented). For example:

```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@leaf.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
```
